## How to use Bats! HIIT

### Workout structure

A HIIT workout with Bats! HIIT comprises a sequence of alternating rest (warm up/cool down) intervals and work blocks. For example, a workout with two workout blocks will look like

1. warm up
2. block #1
3. rest
4. block #2
5. cool down

Bats! HIIT always inserts rest intervals between blocks, and always includes a warm up and cool down interval.

The length of the rest interval is configurable. By default, it is 60 seconds.

### Block structure

A block is a series of work/break interval pairs; each work interval has a corresponding break interval. For example, you might configure Bats! HIIT to include 4 work intervals per block, with a 50 second work interval and 10 second break. Such a block would take 4 minutes.

### Audio and visual cues

Bats! HIIT always gives a warning consisting of 4 short chirps when you're about to transition to a new interval. Every work interval begins with a single high-pitched beep; break intervals begin with a descending, two-tone beep. Rest intervals do not have an initial beep.

During work intervals, your phone's screen will be green. In breaks, the screen will turn yellow. Rest is indicated by a red background. Your phone will also tell you how long is left in the present sub-interval and how many work/break pairs and blocks remain.

### Screen lock

When you're exercising, you want to be able to see your progress without unlocking your screen. Bats! HIIT prevents your screen from turning off, though it does allow it to dim for power savings. This lets you know at a glance how you're doing.

### Save/recall workout

You can save/recall/delete stored workouts. "Last workout" is automatically created whenever you do a workout, and is restored when the app is next started.

### Pause workout

If Bats! HIIT loses focus during a workout, your workout will be paused and will resume when Bats! HIIT resumes.

### Delay locked loop

To ensure that your workout is accurately timed, Bats! HIIT implements a feedback system called a [delay-locked loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delay-locked_loop). Every second, when Bats! HIIT wakes up to update the timer readout, it measures how long it was actually asleep and adjusts future delay intervals to hit the target 1-second sleep interval. In practice, this reduces short-term timing errors from more than 5% to about 0.2%; since the error is integrated over the life of your workout, the overall accuracy is two to three orders of magnitude better than the short-term errors.

## Development environment

### Requirements

+ `adb`: used to synchronize the development environment with a device (mobile phone, tablet, etc...)
+ `sdk`: a useful tool to easily install `gradle` versions
+ `gradle`: used to build the application
+ A text editor/processor

### Install tools

+ Follow [this instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) to install `adb`.
+ Follow [this instructions](https://sdkman.io/install) to install `sdk`
+ To install `gradle` simply type `sdk install gradle 2.14.1` and type `Y` when the cli asks if you want to use it as the current `sdk` version. This project will only work with gradle version `2.14.1`.
+ Check the gradle version using `gradle --version`. It should be 

### Installing the application in a device

#### ADB connection

First let's synchronize the device usibg adb

+ Type `adb devices`
+ No device should appear unless you connected it by USB. In that case your device is now synchronized with your computer
+ If you want to synchronize it using Wi-Fi you must first enable tcp connections.
+ Type `adb tcpip 5555` to start listening to connections
+ Check that your phone and computer are connected to the same network
+ Now check which is your device's IP address. This can be typically found in `Settings -> System -> About the phone -> State -> IP address`
+ Let's assume your IP is `192.168.0.156`, then type `adb connect 192.168.0.156`.
+ The device should be connected. Check that out typing `adb devices`.

#### Using gradle

Gradle is a tool that we use to build the source code, run tests, release applications, and perform many other tasks.

To build the application we can just type:

+ `gradle installDebug`

It will automatically install the application in your phone using `adb`, that'ÃŸ why we need to establish (synchronize) an adb connection first.

Check what other tasks can be performed:

+ `gradle tasks`
